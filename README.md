About this project!
golosICO - platform for holding ICO companies on the blockchain Golos! This platform is a thin client, that works without a backend (only frontend and blockchain) directly on the GitHub Pages (through CloudFlare).
We use:
__[Golos.js](https://github.com/GolosChain/golos-js) - the JavaScript API for Golos blockchain;
__[Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) - the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
__[jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) - is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library;
__[SweetAlert2](https://github.com/limonte/sweetalert2) - a beautiful, responsive, customizable, accessible replacement for JavaScript's popup boxes.
